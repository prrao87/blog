I'm a data scientist, developer and engineer with a scientific consulting background. My long-term interests are in Natural Language Processing (NLP), knowledge representation/reasoning and large-scale process automation. I am passionate about building intelligent, end-to-end automated systems using a range of machine learning and database technologies. I also enjoy communicating technical concepts to a broad and varied audience.

In the past, I've worked on a range of technical problems, from running computational physics simulations, to making complex data visualizations and building end-to-end machine learning workflows. My primary tools of choice are Python, numpy, pandas, PyTorch and Spark. I'm currently fascinated by (and am actively learning) the Julia programming language.
